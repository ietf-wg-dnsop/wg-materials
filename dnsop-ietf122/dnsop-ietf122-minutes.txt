Minutes by Paul Hoffman

Administrivia, Chairs
	New AD for the WG: Mohamed Boucadair (Med)
		Lots of clapping for Warren
	Opening, Note Well
	90ish people in Meetecho/Zulip
	Lots of review of the past few months in the slides
	Wes Hardaker: Three docs in front of the IESG will have small changes by next week
	Geoff Huston: Reminds the chairs that the DNS Directorate exists for getting reviews

Hackathon results
	See slides
	Six documents had work done

Clarifications on CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC Consistency, Peter Thomassen
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-cds-consistency/
	Maybe ready for WG Last Call

Domain Verification Techniques using DNS, Shumon Huque
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques/
	Ben Schwartz: Domain control validation vs. domain authorization
		Latter is like MX records
		The section on wildcards should go further down
	Daniel Kahn Gilmore: Worried about the overlap beween the DNS and the other networks
		Doesn't want users to be tricked into making claims they don't know
		If a malicious operator can convince users to add records unde the wrong _label, big security issues

DNS Filtering Details for Applications, Mark Nottingham
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-nottingham-public-resolver-errors/
	Gautam Akiwate: DNS filtering is being discussed in ICANN's SSAC
		Safari already displays messages based on DNS error codes
		Need to figure out the trust model for the URLs
	Ben: Doesn't agree with the role for IANA
		Likes the care the draft shows
		Norms from the IETF are paid attention to
		Let's not charge down the wrong path
	Wes: Extended DNS Error draft tried to deal with some of these issues, were told not to
		Can end up displaying messages that are harmful
		Read the WG discussion on EDE, maybe the WG will change
		Mark: Browser vendors deal with this kind of thing all the time
	Vittorio Bertola: This could be in a policy forum
		This should be done
		Should be for everyone, not just public resolvers
	Ralf Weber: Message to be displayed to the users might be a subset of the registry?
		Mark: Now is just a URL
	Mark: Is DNSOP the right venue for this?
		Benno: Need to discuss with the ADs, but for now DNSOP is fine

Clarifications to the DNS Ranking Data, Kazunori Fujiwara
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fujiwara-dnsop-ranking-data/
	Ondřej Surý: DELEG is more important than this
		Willem: Legacy way to do delegations will be around for a while
			Good to bring clarity for that
	Jim Reid: Thinks we have to do both
		Wants to clean up now, DELEG is long in the future
	Ralf: DNS is currently working
		Mixes different functions we have in the DNS
		Might have to change the structure for the future
		Don't change the guidance
		Willem: Not trying to mix everything together
			Collect guidance

Session 2
Date: Thursday, March 20, 2025
Time: 1300-1430 local

Collision Free Keytags for DNSSEC, Shumon Huque
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-huque-dnsop-keytags/
	Jim: Would rather a document that said "you should avoid collisions" instead of "you must not have collisions"
		Suggestions are more moving parts around key generation and validation
		Creating this complexity might cause more problems that it solves
		Mark: BIND has been avoiding key collisions for 20 years
			Now has code for partitioning
		Jim: How often has this actually been seen in the wild
		Shumon: Wants to make the validation process predictable 
	Christian Elmerot: Prefers a flag date
		Easiest option does not involve coordination
		Important draft to get adoption
	Roy Arends: Prevents validators from being abused
		Important to adopt
		Collisions happen more often than you think
	Petr Špaček: We need something like this because different implementations do different things
		Causing operational issues today
	Ralf: Supports this work 
		Overall problem space is low

Distributed DNSSEC Multi-Signer Bootstrap, Johan Stenstam
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-leon-distributed-multi-signer/
Automating DNS Delegation Management via DDNS
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt-via-ddns/
Signalling Key State Via DNS EDNS(0) OPT
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-berra-dnsop-keystate/
	No mic line
	Does not have a strong feeling about whether they all need to go together

DNS Update with JSON, Paul Hoffman
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hoffman-duj/
	Tobias Fiebig: Likes the draft, needs more work
	Peter Tomasson: Question about having multiple additions or deletions, and whether a DNS host needs to block add-then-remove
		Paul: Answered on the list earlier today
	Paweł Kowalik: Caution about using DUJS instead of DUJ64 because quotation marks might be munged in the browser

Domain Name System (DNS) Public Key Based Request and Transaction Authentication ( SIG(0) ), Donald Eastlake
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-eastlake-dnsop-rfc2931bis-sigzero/
	Ted Lemon: Using SIG(0) heavily in SRP document, soon to be published
		Likes a new RRTYPE as a first guess
	Petr: How compatible is this with current SIG(0) deployment?
		Donald: Not sure, but will research
		Petr: Probably prefer new RRtype		
		
dry-run DNSSEC, Yorgos Thessalonikefs
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-yorgos-dnsop-dry-run-dnssec/
	Petr: What is the interaction with aggressive caching?
		Are resolvers supposed to act as if the zone is signed?
		Yorgos: Need to think about it?
	Peter: Instead of just signing a zone with dry-run, also test parents' checking
		Would not help with a wildcard error
		Should think about the checks that the parents should be doing
		Jorgos: Likes this

A Top-level Domain for Private Use, Warren Kumari
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davies-internal-tld/
	Ted: Should work on this
	Tommy Jensen: Work on here
		Consider that libraries MAY treat it as special to catch things from going upstream
	Stuart Cheshire: Agree with logic, should be listed in registry
	Jim: Not for IETF because ICANN told us what to do
		Maybe figure out the process
		Thanks for bearing with all the machinations
	Mark: Locally served registry requires that the names have insecure delegations in the DNS
		Bring-your-own-devices work because of this insecure validation
	Suzanne: How much work is needed?
		Warren: Almost no work
